# Heart-Attack-Predictor
Developed a predictive ML model using a Kaggle heart health dataset to assess the risk of heart attack based on lifestyle and biometric indicators.

Key Highlights:

üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized feature types, and removed noise from the dataset.

üìä Feature Engineering & Scaling: Engineered relevant health metrics (e.g., BMI, stress, triglycerides) and applied Min-Max & Standard scaling for model optimization.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends and correlations through histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots to guide feature selection and understand risk patterns.

ü§ñ Modeling: Trained and evaluated a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, achieving improved accuracy through feature normalization and hyperparameter tuning.

Tools & Skills Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, EDA, Feature Engineering, Classification Models

And we used different models to see the performance difference of each model.
